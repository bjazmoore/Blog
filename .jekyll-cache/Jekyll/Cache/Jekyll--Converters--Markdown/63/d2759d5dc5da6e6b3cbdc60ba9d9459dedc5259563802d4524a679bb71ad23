In this post, we will learn how to manipulate and style and image using kramdown parser, since Bajawa jekyll theme using kramdown as its parser. NOTE: This tutorial doesnâ€™t require changing in CSS. Image Sizing: To embed image in markdown language, here is the code: ![Bajawa Test Image](/assets/images/testimage. jpg)Above code doesnâ€™t change image resolution. The image size is 1920px x 1271px. Maybe, itâ€™s too big to be displayed as a post image. Resize it manually using photo editor is too troublesome (if youâ€™re not lazy, then go ahead). The image sample is here. With kramdown parser, try below approach to resize image without changing the CSS: ![Bajawa Test Image](/assets/images/testimage. jpg){:height= auto  width= 600px }![Bajawa Test Image](/assets/images/testimage. jpg){:class= img-responsive }![Bajawa Test Image](/assets/images/testimage. jpg){:height= 50%  width= 50% }This is the sample of ![Bajawa Test Image](/assets/images/testimage. jpg){:height= auto  width= 600px : How is it? Image Caption: Unfortunately, giving a caption into image in markdown language is unavailable right now. Weâ€™re trying to research that but the result is far from perfect. In that case, to give caption in the image, we could combine figure html tag with img src as an alternative. This is the example: &lt;figure style= width: 600px  class= align-center &gt;&lt;img src= http://localhost:4000/assets/images/testimage. jpg  alt=  &gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;This is caption&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;And the result will be like this:  This is caption example.

    "body": "2020/09/22 - Once upon a time, a certain ronin, Tajima Shume by name, an able and well-read man, being on his travels to see the world, went up to Kiyoto by the Tokaido. [The road of the Eastern Sea, the famous highroad leading from Kiyoto to Yedo. The name is also used to indicate the provinces through which it runs. ] One day, in the neighbourhood of Nagoya, in the province of Owari, he fell in with a wandering priest, with whom he entered into conversation. Finding that they were bound for the same place, they agreed to travel together, beguiling their weary way by pleasant talk on divers matters; and so by degrees, as they became more intimate, they began to speak without restraint about their private affairs; and the priest, trusting thoroughly in the honour of his companion, told him the object of his journey. â€œFor some time past,â€ said he, â€œI have nourished a wish that has engrossed all my thoughts; for I am bent on setting up a molten image in honour of Buddha; with this object I have wandered through various provinces collecting alms, and (who knows by what weary toil?) we have succeeded in amassing two hundred ounces of silverâ€”enough, I trust, to erect a handsome bronze figure. â€ What says the proverb? â€œHe who bears a jewel in his bosom bears poison. â€ Hardly had the ronin heard these words of the priest than an evil heart arose within him, and he thought to himself, â€œManâ€™s life, from the womb to the grave, is made up of good and of ill luck. Here am I, nearly forty years old, a wanderer, without a calling, or even a hope of advancement in the world. To be sure, it seems a shame; yet if I could steal the money this priest is boasting about, I could live at ease for the rest of my days;â€ and so he began casting about how best he might compass his purpose. But the priest, far from guessing the drift of his comradeâ€™s thoughts, journeyed cheerfully on till they reached the town of Kuana. Here there is an arm of the sea, which is crossed in ferry-boats, that start as soon as some twenty or thirty passengers are gathered together; and in one of these boats the two travellers embarked. About half-way across, the priest was taken with a sudden necessity to go to the side of the boat; and the ronin, following him, tripped him up while no one was looking, and flung him into the sea. When the boatmen and passengers heard the splash, and saw the priest struggling in the water, they were afraid, and made every effort to save him; but the wind was fair, and the boat running swiftly under the bellying sails; so they were soon a few hundred yards off from the drowning man, who sank before the boat could be turned to rescue him. When he saw this, the ronin feigned the utmost grief and dismay, and said to his fellow-passengers, â€œThis priest, whom we have just lost, was my cousin; he was going to Kiyoto, to visit the shrine of his patron; and as I happened to have business there as well, we settled to travel together. Now, alas! by this misfortune, my cousin is dead, and I am left alone. â€ He spoke so feelingly, and wept so freely, that the passengers believed his story, and pitied and tried to comfort him. Then the ronin said to the boatmen: â€œWe ought, by rights, to report this matter to the authorities; but as I am pressed for time, and the business might bring trouble on yourselves as well, perhaps we had better hush it up for the present; I will at once go on to Kiyoto and tell my cousinâ€™s patron, besides writing home about it. What think you, gentlemen?â€ added he, turning to the other travellers. They, of course, were only too glad to avoid any hindrance to their onward journey, and all with one voice agreed to what the ronin had proposed; and so the matter was settled. When, at length, they reached the shore, they left the boat, and every man went his way; but the ronin, overjoyed in his heart, took the wandering priestâ€™s luggage, and, putting it with his own, pursued his journey to Kiyoto. On reaching the capital, the ronin changed his name from Shume to Tokubei, and, giving up his position as a samurai, turned merchant, and traded with the dead manâ€™s money. Fortune favouring his speculations, he began to amass great wealth, and lived at his ease, denying himself nothing; and in course of time he married a wife, who bore him a child. Thus the days and months wore on, till one fine summerâ€™s night, some three years after the priestâ€™s death, Tokubei stepped out on the veranda of his house to enjoy the cool air and the beauty of the moonlight. Feeling dull and lonely, he began musing over all kinds of things, when on a sudden the deed of murder and theft, done so long ago, vividly recurred to his memory, and he thought to himself, â€œHere am I, grown rich and fat on the money I wantonly stole. Since then, all has gone well with me; yet, had I not been poor, I had never turned assassin nor thief. Woe betide me! what a pity it was!â€ and as he was revolving the matter in his mind, a feeling of remorse came over him, in spite of all he could do. While his conscience thus smote him, he suddenly, to his utter amazement, beheld the faint outline of a man standing near a fir-tree in the garden; on looking more attentively, he perceived that the manâ€™s whole body was thin and worn, and the eyes sunken and dim; and in that poor ghost that was before him he recognised the very priest whom he had thrown into the sea at Kuana. Chilled with horror, he looked again, and saw that the priest was smiling in scorn. He would have fled into the house, but the ghost stretched forth its withered arm, and, clutching the back of his neck, scowled at him with a vindictive glare and a hideous ghastliness of mien so unspeakably awful that any ordinary man would have swooned with fear. But Tokubei, tradesman though he was, had once been a soldier, and was not easily matched for daring; so he shook off the ghost, and, leaping into the room for his dirk, laid about him boldly enough; but, strike as he would, the spirit, fading into the air, eluded his blows, and suddenly reappeared only to vanish again; and from that time forth Tokubei knew no rest, and was haunted night and day. At length, undone by such ceaseless vexation, Tokubei fell ill, and kept muttering, â€œOh, misery! misery! the wandering priest is coming to torture me!â€ Hearing his moans and the disturbance he made, the people in the house fancied he was mad, and called in a physician, who prescribed for him. But neither pill nor potion could cure Tokubei, whose strange frenzy soon became the talk of the whole neighbourhood. Now it chanced that the story reached the ears of a certain wandering priest who lodged in the next street. When he heard the particulars, this priest gravely shook his head as though he knew all about it, and sent a friend to Tokubeiâ€™s house to say that a wandering priest, dwelling hard by, had heard of his illness, and, were it never so grievous, would undertake to heal it by means of his prayers; and Tokubeiâ€™s wife, driven half wild by her husbandâ€™s sickness, lost not a moment in sending for the priest and taking him into the sick manâ€™s room. But no sooner did Tokubei see the priest than he yelled out, â€œHelp! help! Here is the wandering priest come to torment me again. Forgive! forgive!â€ and hiding his head under the coverlet, he lay quivering all over. Then the priest turned all present out of the room, put his mouth to the affrighted manâ€™s ear, and whispered: â€œThree years ago, at the Kuana ferry, you flung me into the water; and well you remember it. â€ But Tokubei was speechless, and could only quake with fear. â€œHappily,â€ continued the priest, â€œI had learned to swim and to dive as a boy; so I reached the shore, and, after wandering through many provinces, succeeded in setting up a bronze figure to Buddha, thus fulfilling the wish of my heart. On my journey homeward, I took a lodging in the next street, and there heard of your marvellous ailment. Thinking I could divine its cause, I came to see you, and am glad to find I was not mistaken. You have done a hateful deed; but am I not a priest, and have I not forsaken the things of this world, and would it not ill become me to bear malice? Repent, therefore, and abandon your evil ways. To see you do so I should esteem the height of happiness. Be of good cheer, now, and look me in the face, and you will see that I am really a living man, and no vengeful goblin come to torment you. â€ Seeing he had no ghost to deal with, and overwhelmed by the priestâ€™s kindness, Tokubei burst into tears, and answered, â€œIndeed, indeed, I donâ€™t know what to say. In a fit of madness I was tempted to kill and rob you. Fortune befriended me ever after; but the richer I grew, the more keenly I felt how wicked I had been, and the more I foresaw that my victimâ€™s vengeance would some day overtake me. Haunted by this thought, I lost my nerve, till one night I beheld your spirit, and from that time fell ill. But how you managed to escape, and are still alive, is more than I can understand. â€ â€œA guilty man,â€ said the priest, with a smile, â€œshudders at the rustling of the wind or the chattering of a storkâ€™s beak; a murdererâ€™s conscience preys upon his mind till he sees what is not. Poverty drives a man to crimes which he repents of in his wealth. How true is the doctrine of Moshi [Mencius], that the heart of man, pure by nature, is corrupted by circumstances!â€ Thus he held forth; and Tokubei, who had long since repented of his crime, implored forgiveness, and gave him a large sum of money, saying, â€œHalf of this is the amount I stole from you three years since; the other half I entreat you to accept as interest, or as a gift. â€ The priest at first refused the money; but Tokubei insisted on his accepting it, and did all he could to detain him, but in vain; for the priest went on his way, and bestowed the money on the poor and needy. As for Tokubei himself, he soon shook off his disorder, and thenceforward lived at peace with all men, revered both at home and abroad, and ever intent on good and charitable deeds.

    "body": "2020/09/21 - Everything was perfectly swell. There were no prisons, no slums, no insane asylums, no cripples, no poverty, no wars. All diseases were conquered. So was old age. Death, barring accidents, was an adventure for volunteers. The population of the United States was stabilized at forty-million souls. One bright morning in the Chicago Lying-in Hospital, a man named Edward K. Wehling, Jr. , waited for his wife to give birth. He was the only man waiting. Not many people were born a day any more. Wehling was fifty-six, a mere stripling in a population whose average age was one hundred and twenty-nine. X-rays had revealed that his wife was going to have triplets. The children would be his first. Young Wehling was hunched in his chair, his head in his hand. He was so rumpled, so still and colorless as to be virtually invisible. His camouflage was perfect, since the waiting room had a disorderly and demoralized air, too. Chairs and ashtrays had been moved away from the walls. The floor was paved with spattered dropcloths. The room was being redecorated. It was being redecorated as a memorial to a man who had volunteered to die. A sardonic old man, about two hundred years old, sat on a stepladder, painting a mural he did not like. Back in the days when people aged visibly, his age would have been guessed at thirty-five or so. Aging had touched him that much before the cure for aging was found. The mural he was working on depicted a very neat garden. Men and women in white, doctors and nurses, turned the soil, planted seedlings, sprayed bugs, spread fertilizer. Men and women in purple uniforms pulled up weeds, cut down plants that were old and sickly, raked leaves, carried refuse to trash-burners. Never, never, neverâ€”not even in medieval Holland nor old Japanâ€”had a garden been more formal, been better tended. Every plant had all the loam, light, water, air and nourishment it could use. A hospital orderly came down the corridor, singing under his breath a popular song:  If you donâ€™t like my kisses, honey,  Hereâ€™s what I will do:  Iâ€™ll go see a girl in purple,  Kiss this sad world toodle-oo.  If you donâ€™t want my lovinâ€™,  Why should I take up all this space?  Iâ€™ll get off this old planet,  Let some sweet baby have my place. The orderly looked in at the mural and the muralist. â€œLooks so real,â€ he said, â€œI can practically imagine Iâ€™m standing in the middle of it. â€ â€œWhat makes you think youâ€™re not in it?â€ said the painter. He gave a satiric smile. â€œItâ€™s called â€˜The Happy Garden of Life,â€™ you know. â€ â€œThatâ€™s good of Dr. Hitz,â€ said the orderly. He was referring to one of the male figures in white, whose head was a portrait of Dr. Benjamin Hitz, the hospitalâ€™s Chief Obstetrician. Hitz was a blindingly handsome man. â€œLot of faces still to fill in,â€ said the orderly. He meant that the faces of many of the figures in the mural were still blank. All blanks were to be filled with portraits of important people on either the hospital staff or from the Chicago Office of the Federal Bureau of Termination. â€œMust be nice to be able to make pictures that look like something,â€ said the orderly. The painterâ€™s face curdled with scorn. â€œYou think Iâ€™m proud of this daub?â€ he said. â€œYou think this is my idea of what life really looks like?â€ â€œWhatâ€™s your idea of what life looks like?â€ said the orderly. The painter gestured at a foul dropcloth. â€œThereâ€™s a good picture of it,â€ he said. â€œFrame that, and youâ€™ll have a picture a damn sight more honest than this one. â€ â€œYouâ€™re a gloomy old duck, arenâ€™t you?â€ said the orderly. â€œIs that a crime?â€ said the painter. The orderly shrugged. â€œIf you donâ€™t like it here, Grandpaâ€”â€ he said, and he finished the thought with the trick telephone number that people who didnâ€™t want to live any more were supposed to call. The zero in the telephone number he pronounced â€œnaught. â€ The number was: â€œ2 B R 0 2 B. â€ It was the telephone number of an institution whose fanciful sobriquets included: â€œAutomat,â€ â€œBirdland,â€ â€œCannery,â€ â€œCatbox,â€ â€œDe-louser,â€ â€œEasy-go,â€ â€œGood-by, Mother,â€ â€œHappy Hooligan,â€ â€œKiss-me-quick,â€ â€œLucky Pierre,â€ â€œSheepdip,â€ â€œWaring Blendor,â€ â€œWeep-no-moreâ€ and â€œWhy Worry?â€ â€œTo be or not to beâ€ was the telephone number of the municipal gas chambers of the Federal Bureau of Termination. The painter thumbed his nose at the orderly. â€œWhen I decide itâ€™s time to go,â€ he said, â€œit wonâ€™t be at the Sheepdip. â€ â€œA do-it-yourselfer, eh?â€ said the orderly. â€œMessy business, Grandpa. Why donâ€™t you have a little consideration for the people who have to clean up after you?â€ The painter expressed with an obscenity his lack of concern for the tribulations of his survivors. â€œThe world could do with a good deal more mess, if you ask me,â€ he said. The orderly laughed and moved on. Wehling, the waiting father, mumbled something without raising his head. And then he fell silent again. A coarse, formidable woman strode into the waiting room on spike heels. Her shoes, stockings, trench coat, bag and overseas cap were all purple, the purple the painter called â€œthe color of grapes on Judgment Day. â€ The medallion on her purple musette bag was the seal of the Service Division of the Federal Bureau of Termination, an eagle perched on a turnstile. The woman had a lot of facial hairâ€”an unmistakable mustache, in fact. A curious thing about gas-chamber hostesses was that, no matter how lovely and feminine they were when recruited, they all sprouted mustaches within five years or so. â€œIs this where Iâ€™m supposed to come?â€ she said to the painter. â€œA lot would depend on what your business was,â€ he said. â€œYou arenâ€™t about to have a baby, are you?â€ â€œThey told me I was supposed to pose for some picture,â€ she said. â€œMy nameâ€™s Leora Duncan. â€ She waited. â€œAnd you dunk people,â€ he said. â€œWhat?â€ she said. â€œSkip it,â€ he said. â€œThat sure is a beautiful picture,â€ she said. â€œLooks just like heaven or something. â€ â€œOr something,â€ said the painter. He took a list of names from his smock pocket. â€œDuncan, Duncan, Duncan,â€ he said, scanning the list. â€œYesâ€”here you are. Youâ€™re entitled to be immortalized. See any faceless body here youâ€™d like me to stick your head on? Weâ€™ve got a few choice ones left. â€ She studied the mural bleakly. â€œGee,â€ she said, â€œtheyâ€™re all the same to me. I donâ€™t know anything about art. â€ â€œA bodyâ€™s a body, eh?â€ he said. â€œAll righty. As a master of fine art, I recommend this body here. â€ He indicated a faceless figure of a woman who was carrying dried stalks to a trash-burner. â€œWell,â€ said Leora Duncan, â€œthatâ€™s more the disposal people, isnâ€™t it? I mean, Iâ€™m in service. I donâ€™t do any disposing. â€ The painter clapped his hands in mock delight. â€œYou say you donâ€™t know anything about art, and then you prove in the next breath that you know more about it than I do! Of course the sheave-carrier is wrong for a hostess! A snipper, a prunerâ€”thatâ€™s more your line. â€ He pointed to a figure in purple who was sawing a dead branch from an apple tree. â€œHow about her?â€ he said. â€œYou like her at all?â€ â€œGoshâ€”â€ she said, and she blushed and became humbleâ€”â€thatâ€”that puts me right next to Dr. Hitz. â€ â€œThat upsets you?â€ he said. â€œGood gravy, no!â€ she said. â€œItâ€™sâ€”itâ€™s just such an honor. â€ â€œAh, Youâ€¦ you admire him, eh?â€ he said. â€œWho doesnâ€™t admire him?â€ she said, worshiping the portrait of Hitz. It was the portrait of a tanned, white-haired, omnipotent Zeus, two hundred and forty years old. â€œWho doesnâ€™t admire him?â€ she said again. â€œHe was responsible for setting up the very first gas chamber in Chicago. â€ â€œNothing would please me more,â€ said the painter, â€œthan to put you next to him for all time. Sawing off a limbâ€”that strikes you as appropriate?â€ â€œThat is kind of like what I do,â€ she said. She was demure about what she did. What she did was make people comfortable while she killed them. And, while Leora Duncan was posing for her portrait, into the waitingroom bounded Dr. Hitz himself. He was seven feet tall, and he boomed with importance, accomplishments, and the joy of living. â€œWell, Miss Duncan! Miss Duncan!â€ he said, and he made a joke. â€œWhat are you doing here?â€ he said. â€œThis isnâ€™t where the people leave. This is where they come in!â€ â€œWeâ€™re going to be in the same picture together,â€ she said shyly. â€œGood!â€ said Dr. Hitz heartily. â€œAnd, say, isnâ€™t that some picture?â€ â€œI sure am honored to be in it with you,â€ she said. â€œLet me tell you,â€ he said, â€œIâ€™m honored to be in it with you. Without women like you, this wonderful world weâ€™ve got wouldnâ€™t be possible. â€ He saluted her and moved toward the door that led to the delivery rooms. â€œGuess what was just born,â€ he said. â€œI canâ€™t,â€ she said. â€œTriplets!â€ he said. â€œTriplets!â€ she said. She was exclaiming over the legal implications of triplets. The law said that no newborn child could survive unless the parents of the child could find someone who would volunteer to die. Triplets, if they were all to live, called for three volunteers. â€œDo the parents have three volunteers?â€ said Leora Duncan. â€œLast I heard,â€ said Dr. Hitz, â€œthey had one, and were trying to scrape another two up. â€ â€œI donâ€™t think they made it,â€ she said. â€œNobody made three appointments with us. Nothing but singles going through today, unless somebody called in after I left. Whatâ€™s the name?â€ â€œWehling,â€ said the waiting father, sitting up, red-eyed and frowzy. â€œEdward K. Wehling, Jr. , is the name of the happy father-to-be. â€ He raised his right hand, looked at a spot on the wall, gave a hoarsely wretched chuckle. â€œPresent,â€ he said. â€œOh, Mr. Wehling,â€ said Dr. Hitz, â€œI didnâ€™t see you. â€ â€œThe invisible man,â€ said Wehling. â€œThey just phoned me that your triplets have been born,â€ said Dr. Hitz. â€œTheyâ€™re all fine, and so is the mother. Iâ€™m on my way in to see them now. â€ â€œHooray,â€ said Wehling emptily. â€œYou donâ€™t sound very happy,â€ said Dr. Hitz. â€œWhat man in my shoes wouldnâ€™t be happy?â€ said Wehling. He gestured with his hands to symbolize care-free simplicity. â€œAll I have to do is pick out which one of the triplets is going to live, then deliver my maternal grandfather to the Happy Hooligan, and come back here with a receipt. â€ Dr. Hitz became rather severe with Wehling, towered over him. â€œYou donâ€™t believe in population control, Mr. Wehling?â€ he said. â€œI think itâ€™s perfectly keen,â€ said Wehling tautly. â€œWould you like to go back to the good old days, when the population of the Earth was twenty billionâ€”about to become forty billion, then eighty billion, then one hundred and sixty billion? Do you know what a drupelet is, Mr. Wehling?â€ said Hitz. â€œNope,â€ said Wehling sulkily. â€œA drupelet, Mr. Wehling, is one of the little knobs, one of the little pulpy grains of a blackberry,â€ said Dr. Hitz. â€œWithout population control, human beings would now be packed on this surface of this old planet like drupelets on a blackberry! Think of it!â€ Wehling continued to stare at the same spot on the wall. â€œIn the year 2000,â€ said Dr. Hitz, â€œbefore scientists stepped in and laid down the law, there wasnâ€™t even enough drinking water to go around, and nothing to eat but sea-weedâ€”and still people insisted on their right to reproduce like jackrabbits. And their right, if possible, to live forever. â€ â€œI want those kids,â€ said Wehling quietly. â€œI want all three of them. â€ â€œOf course you do,â€ said Dr. Hitz. â€œThatâ€™s only human. â€ â€œI donâ€™t want my grandfather to die, either,â€ said Wehling. â€œNobodyâ€™s really happy about taking a close relative to the Catbox,â€ said Dr. Hitz gently, sympathetically. â€œI wish people wouldnâ€™t call it that,â€ said Leora Duncan. â€œWhat?â€ said Dr. Hitz. â€œI wish people wouldnâ€™t call it â€˜the Catbox,â€™ and things like that,â€ she said. â€œIt gives people the wrong impression. â€ â€œYouâ€™re absolutely right,â€ said Dr. Hitz. â€œForgive me. â€ He corrected himself, gave the municipal gas chambers their official title, a title no one ever used in conversation. â€œI should have said, â€˜Ethical Suicide Studios,â€™â€ he said. â€œThat sounds so much better,â€ said Leora Duncan. â€œThis child of yoursâ€”whichever one you decide to keep, Mr. Wehling,â€ said Dr. Hitz. â€œHe or she is going to live on a happy, roomy, clean, rich planet, thanks to population control. In a garden like that mural there. â€ He shook his head. â€œTwo centuries ago, when I was a young man, it was a hell that nobody thought could last another twenty years. Now centuries of peace and plenty stretch before us as far as the imagination cares to travel. â€ He smiled luminously. The smile faded as he saw that Wehling had just drawn a revolver. Wehling shot Dr. Hitz dead. â€œThereâ€™s room for oneâ€”a great big one,â€ he said. And then he shot Leora Duncan. â€œItâ€™s only death,â€ he said to her as she fell. â€œThere! Room for two. â€ And then he shot himself, making room for all three of his children. Nobody came running. Nobody, seemingly, heard the shots. The painter sat on the top of his stepladder, looking down reflectively on the sorry scene. The painter pondered the mournful puzzle of life demanding to be born and, once born, demanding to be fruitful â€¦ to multiply and to live as long as possibleâ€”to do all that on a very small planet that would have to last forever. All the answers that the painter could think of were grim. Even grimmer, surely, than a Catbox, a Happy Hooligan, an Easy Go. He thought of war. He thought of plague. He thought of starvation. He knew that he would never paint again. He let his paintbrush fall to the drop-cloths below. And then he decided he had had about enough of life in the Happy Garden of Life, too, and he came slowly down from the ladder. He took Wehlingâ€™s pistol, really intending to shoot himself. But he didnâ€™t have the nerve. And then he saw the telephone booth in the corner of the room. He went to it, dialed the well-remembered number: â€œ2 B R 0 2 B. â€ â€œFederal Bureau of Termination,â€ said the very warm voice of a hostess. â€œHow soon could I get an appointment?â€ he asked, speaking very carefully. â€œWe could probably fit you in late this afternoon, sir,â€ she said. â€œIt might even be earlier, if we get a cancellation. â€ â€œAll right,â€ said the painter, â€œfit me in, if you please. â€ And he gave her his name, spelling it out. â€œThank you, sir,â€ said the hostess. â€œYour city thanks you; your country thanks you; your planet thanks you. But the deepest thanks of all is from future generations. â€ THE END End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of 2 B R 0 2 B, by Kurt Vonnegut END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK 2 B R 0 2 B This file should be named 21279-h. htm or 21279-h. zipThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:    http://www. gutenberg. org/2/1/2/7/21279/ Produced by Robert Cicconetti, Geetu Melwani and the OnlineDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www. pgdp. net.
